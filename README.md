This is the repository for storing all files related to my final year project on creating a "Music Recommendation system using Content Based classification".
A full report along with a power point presentation are included to give a full overview of the theory and work used to successfully implement our recommendation system.

The front-end of the application was implemented using Python and the PyQt libraries.

The back-end was implemented with python, sql and the dropbox api for storing the test songs.
